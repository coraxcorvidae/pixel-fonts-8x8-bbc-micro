# pixel-fonts-8x8-bbc-micro

A collection of BBC Micro font files from public domain sources converted to PNG format for use on modern systems for retro style games or any other use you can think of.

Bitmaps of the fonts are in **png-fonts**. These are for whatever use you have for them.

The original Arthur/RISC OS/BBC Micro/Acorn Electron/BBC BASIC for any platform fonts are in **vdu-fonts**. To load them on a real/emulated platform just ***EXEC filename.vdu**.

These fonts were gathered from a collection of BBC Micro public domain software disks eons ago and are presented as-is with no warranty or implied claim of ownership. Originally these were created for use in [Pixel-Engine](https://github.com/coraxcorvidae/Pixel-Engine/) projects.

## Acknowledgments

Many thanks to the original creators of these fonts whoever you are!
